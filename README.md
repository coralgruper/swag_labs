## Swag Labs Test Plan
### 1. Introduction 

This document outlines the methods and procedures for the automated testing of SWAG LABS, a simulated web application designed for e-commerce shopping. The primary purpose of this test plan is to ensure a structured approach for verifying the application's functionality, usability, and performance, guaranteeing a stable and reliable user experience.

### 2. Testing Objectives
#### The objectives of automated testing for the Swag Labs application are as follows:

- Ensure that the Swag Labs application is stable, reliable, and meets user requirements.
- Increase the speed of testing to enable faster release cycles.
- Reduce manual effort, thereby decreasing overall testing costs.

### 3. Testing Scope
#### The scope of testing will encompass:

- Functional Testing: Verifying that core functionalities work as expected.
- Usability Testing: Ensuring that the application is intuitive and user-friendly.
- Regression Testing: Ensuring that new updates or features do not negatively impact existing functionalities.
- UI Testing: Confirming that the user interface elements render correctly and consistently across supported environments.
- System Integration Testing: Verifying that all integrated components function together seamlessly.

### 4. Testing Approach
#### The testing process will follow these stages:

- Manual Testing: Initial testing will be conducted manually to establish baseline functionality and identify any preliminary issues.
- Automated Testing: After initial validation, automated tests will be developed and executed to ensure consistent coverage across future releases and updates.

### 5. Testing Environment and Tools
#### The test environment is configured as follows:
- Operating System: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22631.4317]
- Browser: Google Chrome Version 130.0.6723.70
- Programming Language: Python 3.8.8
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): PyCharm 2021.2.2

#### Automation Tools:
- Selenium Version 4.21.0: For browser automation.
- Pytest Version 8.3.2: For structuring and executing test cases.

### 6. Testing Deliverables
#### The following functionality will be covered by automated tests:

- User Authentication: Verifying successful login and logout functionalities.
- Product Sorting: Testing the ability to sort products by Name and Price.
- Shopping Cart Operations: Ensuring the correct functionality of adding and removing items from the cart.
- Checkout Process: Validating the end-to-end checkout workflow.
- Application Reset: Testing the reset functionality for clearing app data and settings.
- Logout: Ensuring that users can log out securely.

### 7. Risks
#### The following risks have been identified in the testing process:

- No Development Support: Limited or no access to a development team for bug fixes may impact the resolution of identified issues.
- Data Sensitivity: Using real data during testing may lead to potential data exposure or security risks.
- Production Environment Testing: Conducting tests in a production environment may unintentionally impact active users, leading to potential downtime or interference.
